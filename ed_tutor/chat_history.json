 {'question': 'What answer did I put, and why was it wrong?', 'answer': "You chose answer 'A', which was incorrect. This answer suggested that electrons are in the nucleus of an atom and that they repel protons, leading to atomic stability. However, this is not accurate. Electrons actually orbit the nucleus in what are called electron shells and do not directly interact with protons to maintain atomic stability."}
