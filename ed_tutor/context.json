{'question': "Which of the following statements correctly describes the interaction between subatomic particles in an atom?\nA) Electrons in an atom's nucleus repel protons, leading to atomic stability.B) Neutrons stabilize the nucleus by offsetting the electrostatic repulsion between electrons and protons.C) Protons and electrons in the nucleus attract each other, preventing the atom from collapsing.D) The absence of charge in neutrons contributes to the electrostatic balance between protons and electrons in the atom.", 'correct_answer': 'D', 'student answer': 'A', 'message': "The student's answer is incorrect because it incorrectly places electrons in the nucleus of an atom and suggests that they repel protons, leading to atomic stability. According to the class notes, electrons orbit the nucleus in electron shells and do not directly interact with protons to maintain atomic stability. The correct answer is D, which aligns with the class notes that neutrons, having no charge, contribute to the electrostatic balance in the atom by stabilizing the nucleus."}
